        <h2>My Teaching Practice</h2>
            <p>As a future woodwork and Industrial Technology teacher, I’m passionate about creating a workshop where every student feels welcome, supported, and inspired to learn. I want my classroom to be a place where practical skills meet creativity, and where students can see the value of what they’re making in the real world. Rita Pierson reminds us that “kids don’t learn from people they don’t like,” and this resonates deeply with me because relationships and trust must come first.</p> 
            <p>I aim to design lessons that are hands-on, relevant, and adaptable to different abilities and interests. Whether a student dreams of becoming a tradesperson, a designer, or simply enjoys working on a project for the satisfaction of building something, I want them to feel that there is a place for them in my class. Like Pierson, I believe every student needs a champion who refuses to give up on them and helps them discover their strengths even when they doubt themselves.</p> 
            <p>For me, teaching is about more than just passing on skills. It is about building confidence, encouraging curiosity, and showing students that problem-solving and persistence are as important as the finished product. Pierson’s call to educators to “make a difference” reminds me that my role is not only to guide technique but also to help shape resilient, motivated learners who know they are capable of growth.</p> 
            <p>From timber joinery to CAD modelling and sustainable design, I want to give my students experiences that will not only prepare them for industry but also help them develop a lifelong appreciation for making, creating, and thinking differently. Just as Rita Pierson championed the belief that every child is worth investing in, I want my workshop to be a space where students see their potential, value their learning journey, and feel empowered to succeed.</p>

            <p>My teaching philosophy is built around the idea that learning should spark curiosity, creativity, and a genuine sense of achievement. In the workshop, I see education as more than just learning techniques – it’s about helping students find purpose in what they make and the skills they develop along the way.</p>
            <p>I aim to create a space that is safe, inclusive, and inspiring for all learners. This means designing projects that reflect real-world trades, encourage problem-solving, and celebrate different perspectives and cultural backgrounds. I also believe in embedding sustainability into my teaching so students understand how their work connects to the world around them.</p>
            <p>As a lifelong learner myself, I’m committed to staying connected with industry, exploring new teaching methods, and constantly improving my practice. Whether it’s through hands-on timber work, CAD design, or creative prototyping, I want students to leave my class with skills they can use, confidence in their abilities, and the belief that they can turn their ideas into reality.</p>
