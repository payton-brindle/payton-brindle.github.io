            <p>As a future woodwork and Industrial Technology teacher, I’m passionate about creating a workshop where every student feels welcome, supported, and inspired to learn. I want my classroom to be a place where practical skills meet creativity, and where students can see the value of what they’re making in the real world.</p>
            <p>I aim to design lessons that are hands-on, relevant, and adaptable to different abilities and interests. Whether a student dreams of becoming a tradesperson, a designer, or simply enjoys working on a project for the satisfaction of building something, I want them to feel that there’s a place for them in my class.</p>
            <p>For me, teaching is about more than just passing on skills – it’s about building confidence, encouraging curiosity, and showing students that problem-solving and persistence are as important as the finished product. I believe in giving them the freedom to explore ideas, make mistakes, and learn from them.</p>
            <p>From timber joinery to CAD modelling and sustainable design, I want to give my students experiences that will not only prepare them for industry but also help them develop a lifelong appreciation for making, creating, and thinking differently.</p>

            <p>My teaching philosophy is built around the idea that learning should spark curiosity, creativity, and a genuine sense of achievement. In the workshop, I see education as more than just learning techniques – it’s about helping students find purpose in what they make and the skills they develop along the way.</p>
            <p>I aim to create a space that is safe, inclusive, and inspiring for all learners. This means designing projects that reflect real-world trades, encourage problem-solving, and celebrate different perspectives and cultural backgrounds. I also believe in embedding sustainability into my teaching so students understand how their work connects to the world around them.</p>
            <p>As a lifelong learner myself, I’m committed to staying connected with industry, exploring new teaching methods, and constantly improving my practice. Whether it’s through hands-on timber work, CAD design, or creative prototyping, I want students to leave my class with skills they can use, confidence in their abilities, and the belief that they can turn their ideas into reality.</p>
