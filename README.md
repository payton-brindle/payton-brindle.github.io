This repository contains the source code for my personal teaching portfolio, which is published at payton-brindle.github.io
 using GitHub Pages. The site is built entirely with HTML and CSS, making it lightweight, easy to customise, and accessible for anyone who wants to adapt it into their own personal or professional portfolio. The structure includes several standalone HTML pages such as the homepage, about, teaching practice, projects, resume, and contact, all of which share a consistent layout and styling provided by a single CSS file called starter.css. All assets, such as images and logos, are stored in the images directory.
